At present, there are two theoretical bases for distributed transaction: CAP law BASE theory.</p>\n<h2>CAP's law</h2>\n<p>The content of this theorem is that in a distributed system, Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance can not be combined.</p>\n<h3>Consistency（C）</h3>\n<p>Whether all data backups in a distributed system have the same value at the same time. (equal to all nodes accessing the same latest copy of data)</p>\n<h3>Availability（A）</h3>\n<p>Whether the whole cluster can respond to the client's read and write requests after some nodes fail in the cluster. (High availability for data updates)</p>\n<h3>Partition tolerance（P）</h3>\n<p>In practical terms, partitioning is equivalent to the time limit requirement for communication.\nIf the system can not achieve data consistency within the time limit, it means that partitioning has occurred, and the current operation must be chosen between C and A.</p>\n<h2>BASE's theory</h2>\n<p>BASE is the abbreviation of three phrases: Basically Available, Soft state and Eventually consistent.\nBASE theory is the result of the trade-off between consistency and availability in CAP.\nIt comes from the summary of the distributed practice of large-scale Internet systems and is based on the gradual evolution of CAP theorem.\nThe core idea of BASE theory is that every application can adopt appropriate ways to achieve the final consistency according to its own business characteristics, even if it can not achieve strong consistency.</p>\n<h3>Basically Available</h3>\n<p>Basic availability means that distributed systems are allowed to lose part of their availability when unpredictable failures occur - note that this is by no means equivalent to system unavailability.\nFor example:</p>\n<p>(1) Loss of response time. Normally, an online search engine needs to return the corresponding query results to the user within 0.5 seconds,\nbut the response time of the query results increases by 1-2 seconds due to the failure.</p>\n<p>(2) Functional loss of the system: Normally, when shopping on an e-commerce website, consumers can almost complete every order smoothly,\nbut in some Festival shopping rush, due to the surge in consumer shopping behavior, in order to protect the stability of the shopping system,\nsome consumers may be guided to a degraded page.</p>\n<h3>Soft State</h3>\n<p>Soft state means that the data in the system is allowed to exist in the intermediate state,\nand it is considered that the existence of the intermediate state will not affect the overall availability of the system,\nthat is to say, there is a delay in the process of allowing the system to synchronize data among the replicas of different nodes.</p>\n<h3>Eventually Consistent</h3>\n<p>Ultimate consistency emphasizes that all data replicas can eventually achieve a consistent state after a period of synchronization.\nTherefore, the essence of final consistency is that the system is required to ensure that the final data can be consistent,\nrather than real-time guarantee of strong consistency of system data.</p>\n",
